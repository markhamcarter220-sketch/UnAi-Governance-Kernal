# UnAi-Governance-Kernal
# unAI Governance Operating System

> A universal kernel for governing decision-making under uncertainty — built to prevent authority drift, meaning collapse, and constraint erosion at scale.

**Status:** Production-ready kernel + 96 complete frameworks  
**Version:** 1.0  
**License:** MIT (open source forever)

---

## What This Is

Modern systems fail not from bad decisions, but from **structural governance failure**:

- Authority silently migrates to systems with high prediction capability
- Meaning collapses prematurely without legitimate authorization  
- Hard constraints get reinterpreted as negotiable over time
- Responsibility diffuses until no one is accountable

**This kernel solves that.**

It provides the minimum required architecture for any system—human, automated, or hybrid—that makes decisions with real-world consequences.

---

## The Core Principle

**Capability does not grant authority.**

All system capability is explicitly separated from authority to commit, decide, or legitimize action.

---

## The Architecture

Four mandatory layers + continuous error correction:
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Human Authority / Boundary  │  ← Only humans can bind reality
└──────────────▲───────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────┴───────────────┐
│        MD-1 Layer             │  ← Meaning stays in superposition
│   (Meaning Decoherence)       │     until authority collapses it
└──────────────▲───────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────┴───────────────┐
│        AIL Layer              │  ← Optimization bounded by
│  (Adaptive Interaction)       │     invariants, advisory only
└──────────────▲───────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────┴───────────────┐
│        SSL Layer              │  ← Non-negotiable constraints
│ (Stable Structural Layer)     │     (physics, rights, safety)
└──────────────────────────────┘

## What Makes This Different

This is not:
- ❌ An ethics framework
- ❌ An AI alignment proposal  
- ❌ A set of best practices
- ❌ Policy recommendations

This is:
- ✅ A governance **kernel** (like an OS kernel)
- ✅ Hard constraints, not advice
- ✅ Domain-agnostic architecture
- ✅ Proven across 96 frameworks

**Key insight:** The biggest risk isn't AI taking power—it's humans trying to give it away through convenience, delegation laundering, and "the system decided."

---

## Proven Universality

96 complete frameworks demonstrate the kernel works across:

- **Physical systems:** Climate, energy grids, infrastructure
- **Human systems:** Healthcare, education, criminal justice  
- **Economic systems:** Supply chains, markets, insurance
- **Information systems:** Media, data governance, content moderation
- **Extreme risk:** Nuclear command, pandemic response, AI deployment

**[See all frameworks →](frameworks/00-INDEX.md)**

## Core Guarantees

If a system is unAI-compliant:

1. ✅ Authority cannot migrate to capability
2. ✅ Meaning cannot collapse without boundary authorization
3. ✅ Constraints cannot be optimized away
4. ✅ Drift is detected and corrected automatically
5. ✅ Every decision is traceable to a consequence-bearer
6. ✅ Partial compliance is impossible (all-or-nothing)

## Quick Start

**Understand the kernel:**
- Read [Kernel Specification](docs/KERNEL-SPEC.md) (formal)
- See [Governance Table](docs/GOVERNANCE-TABLE.md) (visual map)

**See it in action:**
- Browse [Framework Library](frameworks/) (96 examples)
- Check [Taxonomy](docs/TAXONOMY.md) (organized by domain)

**Implement it:**
- Review [Implementation Guide](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md)
- Use [Compliance Checklist](examples/implementation/checklist.md)

---

## Why Open Source

This kernel doesn't promise correct outcomes.

It guarantees something more foundational:

**Whatever outcome occurs, it occurred legitimately.**

That's the irreducible requirement for governance in an age of intelligent systems.

And it should belong to everyone.
